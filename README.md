Number and name of feature: Functionality

Estimate of time needed to complete: 2.5 hours

Start time: 940am

Finish time: 1040pm

Actual time needed to complete: 3 hours

Description: I think II finished functionality a little earlier than 3 hours, but I wanted to convert to drop down menus versus user input to control edge cases for errors, and with that working great I am happy. The reason time is 3 hours compared to the time line is actual time invested. I spent almost 2 hours working out bugs and basic concept, and then revisited much later in the day to dry up code and regulate inputs.

Next: Server, database, and probably changing the templateing, but this all sounds like a fun journey!


Number and name of feature: ES-6 and jQuery Refactor

Estimate of time needed to complete: 1.5 hours

Start time: 11pm

Finish time: 1130pm

Actual time needed to complete: 30 minutes

Notes: Went much smoother than originally thought, but once concept was proven it went very fast. Win!
